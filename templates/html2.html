<h1>FDA Approval Prediction</h1>
<p>Early and accurate identification of promising drug-related research topics can augment human
judgment in resource distribution and accelerate the discovery of novel therapeutics. We leverage
scientific literature data to extract predictive features to identify promising therapeutic research
topics at an early stage using machine learning models.</p>

<p><h2>Drug Development from the Lens of Scientific Literature</h2>
While previous approaches focused on individual trial-level
prediction for drugs, we employed a scientific topic-level
approach to predict promising topics to produce drug
therapeutics. We subdivide the biomedical literature into research topic
clusters (RC). We build a direct citation network using PubMed database and
cluster the articles with high topical cohesion using modularity
maximizing Leiden algorithm. Drugs are mapped to
different clusters based on the position of the research articles
publishing the results of the pivotal trials associated with the
drugs.

<h1>Machine Learning Model for Drug Approval Prediction</h1>
<p>
we extract scientific topic-level features that hold predictive power in indicating tentative drug generation likelihood from a particular topic. We built a logistic regression model to predict the success or failure of a research cluster in generating drug intervention.
